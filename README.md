## Experiments
Original - Image with author proposed parameters

Change_cont_layer - Change the image content layer in Loss definition (conv2_2, conv4_2 ...)

Chage_style_layer - Change the image content layer in Loss definition (conv2_1, conv4_1 ...) 

Chnge_weight - Change weight in loss definition 

Change_start - Change Initial image to perform model optimization (White gaussian noise, content image, stripes ...)

White_noise_starts - Several outome with white gaussian noise start
